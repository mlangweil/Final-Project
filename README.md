# Final-Project
Othello
1. The team will consist of only me
2. The program created will allow two users to play the game Othello. It will allow a user to click and place a game piece on the board. Additionally, it should automatically flip over the pieces that are won by that users piece placement. There will be a max of two users, and only one player can go at a time. When the board is filled up, the program automatically computes how many of each players pieces are on the board, therefore determining the winner. It will also have a play again option.
