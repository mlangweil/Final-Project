# Final-Project
Othello
1. The team will consist of only me
2. The program created will allow two users to play the game Othello. It will allow a user to click and place a game piece on the board. Additionally, it should automatically flip over the pieces that are won by that users piece placement. There will be a max of two users, and only one player can go at a time. When the board is filled up, the program automatically computes how many of each players pieces are on the board, therefore determining the winner. It will also have a play again option.
3. There will be two classes, one being the game piece, and the other being the game board. The first class will be for the game piece and will take in a color. The second will be the individual squares that make up the board and take in the size(will be able to select what size board wanted). The methods will be to move, flip and select where the piece goes. Additionally, one to determine what color piece it is based on the person's turn, a score counter and a play again option.
4. I would need to learn how to use Pygame because I want this game to have a GUI.
5. 5. Highest features are piece selection using the mouse, auto flipping pieces, and the GUI. Medium priority features are a live score counter and presenting user turn. Lowest feature priorities are the play again option and being able to set the size of the board.
